## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Bluetooth not supported" error:
- ✅ **Use Safari browser** (Chrome/Firefox have limited Bluetooth)
- ✅ **Update iPad to iOS 16+** (better Bluetooth support)
- ✅ **Try "📄 Safari Print" button instead**

### Printer not connecting:
- ✅ **Reset printer**: Turn off → Wait 10 seconds → Turn on
- ✅ **Clear Bluetooth cache**: Settings → Bluetooth → Forget device → Re-pair
- ✅ **Check printer compatibility**: XP-58IIH should work with Web Bluetooth

### Myanmar text showing as Chinese:
- ✅ **This is expected** - printer limitation, not iPad issue
- ✅ **English translations will print correctly**
- ✅ **Invoice screen still shows Myanmar text for customers**

### Print quality issues:
- ✅ **Use "🍎 Print Receipt" for thermal printing**
- ✅ **Use "📄 Safari Print" for regular paper printing**
- ✅ **Check paper roll** - thermal paper works best

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **iPad says "Cannot reach print server"**

**Solution:**
1. Check WiFi - both on same network?
2. Check laptop IP didn't change (run `ipconfig`)
3. Check print server is running (terminal window open)
4. Windows Firewall - may need to allow Node.js

**Add firewall rule:**
```powershell
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="POS Print Server" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=3001
```

---

### **Print server stops printing**

**Solution:**
1. Check printer is still ON
2. Check USB cable connected
3. Restart print server (close terminal, run `start-print-server.bat` again)
4. Test print from Windows (Control Panel → Devices → Printers → Print test page)

---

### **Laptop IP keeps changing**

**Solution:** Set static IP

1. Windows Settings → Network & Internet
2. WiFi → Properties → IP settings
3. Edit → Manual → IPv4
4. IP address: `192.168.1.100` (your choice)
5. Subnet: `255.255.255.0`
6. Gateway: `192.168.1.1` (your router)
7. DNS: `8.8.8.8`
8. Save

Now iPad setup only needed once!
